# notes_app

A new Flutter project which is a notes app and illustrates how to make a notes app while using sql with flutter. This can be really interersting if you want to learn about local databases. <br/> This can get a bit confusing so I recommend to atleast have a bit of idea of MySQL and have a good knowledge of dart as that will be a of a great help.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
<br/>This idea is not original and is inspired from another developer.

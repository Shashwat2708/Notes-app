# notes_app

A new Flutter project which is a notes app and illustrates how to make a notes app while using sql with flutter. This can be really interersting if you want to learn about local databases. <br/> This can get a bit confusing so I recommend to atleast have a bit of idea of MySQL and have a good knowledge of dart as that will be a of a great help.
